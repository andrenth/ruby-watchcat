== Introduction

Ruby/Watchcat allows the development of watchcatd-aware applications in
Ruby.

Watchcatd is a watchdog-like daemon in the sense that it takes actions
in situations where a machine is under heavy load and/or unresponsive.
However, watchcatd isn't as drastic as the usual watchdog systems, which
generally reboot the machine. Instead, all it does is sending a signal to
a registered process (which by default is SIGKILL) if the process doesn't
send it a heartbeat before a user-specified timeout.

Ruby/Watchcatd allows a Ruby application to register itself with watchcatd.


== Requirements

Ruby/Watchcatd was tested with Ruby versions >= 1.8.4 and requires watchcatd
version 1.1 and libwcat version 1.0 to be installed (see References below).


== Installation

The easiest way to install Ruby/Watchcat is to use rubygems:

* For the C extension:
 gem install ruby-watchcat

* For the pure-Ruby version:
 gem install ruby-watchcat-pure

The C extension requires you to have the libwcat development package
installed.
